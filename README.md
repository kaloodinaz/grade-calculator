#### Current Grade Calculator

- Intended to help students see what their current grades are by using a weight based grading system.
- Accessibility to as much space for inserting grades as necessary.
- Optionally, students can calculate what is needed to achieve their targeted grade by using the current grade that is calculated, along with the leftover weight.

</div>


#### Final Grade Calculator

- Intended to be used when all grades are distributed except for one final examination.
